function [weights,error_per_iter] = gradient_ascent_fixed(Xtrain,Ytrain,step_size,iterations)
    
    % Function to perform gradient descent with a fixed step size for logistic regression. 
    % Usage: [weights,error_per_iter] = gradient_descent(Xtrain,Ytrain,step_size,iterations)

    % Xtrain : N x P Matrix of training data, where N is the number of
    % training examples, and P is the dimensionality (number of features)
    
    % Ytrain : N x 1 Vector of training labels (0/1)
    
    % step_size : Step size for gradient descent
    %   You will have to play around with this parameter to ensure good
    %   performance. Too high a step size might cause the gradient descent to
    %   not converge at all, while too small a step size might lead to very slow
    %   convergence. Experiment with this value and set it to the one which
    %   you found to work best empirically. You might find it useful to
    %   plot error_per_iter vs iterations to visualize how your gradient
    %   descent is converging. This would be helpful in determining whether
    %   your step size is too high / too low.
    
    % iterations : Maximum number of iterations
    %   In practice, the number of iterations is not fixed. Instead, we continue
    %   to perform gradient descent until the improvement in training error
    %   or the difference in absolute values of the estimated parameters
    %   (weights) across consecutive iterations drops below a certain
    %   predefined threshold. Sometimes, early stopping is also used as a
    %   form of regularization to prevent overfitting (more on that later).
    %   For the given dataset, your implementation should converge within 500 
    %   iterations. If it doesnt, you are probably doing something wrong, or
    %   have not chosen a good step size.
    
   
    %step_size =1e-4;
    %iterations=400;
    
    weights = ones(size(Xtrain,2),1); % P X 1 vector of initial weights
    error_per_iter = zeros(iterations,1); % error_per_iter(i) records training error in iteration i of GD.
    % dont forget to update these values within the loop!
    n = size(Xtrain,1);
    b =glmfit(Xtrain,Ytrain,'binomial','link','logit','constant','off');
    
    for iter = [1:iterations]
        p = exp(Xtrain * weights)./(1+exp(Xtrain*weights)); %probability
        gradiant = 1/n*Xtrain'* (Ytrain - p);
        weights = weights + step_size * gradiant;
        y_predict = exp(Xtrain * weights)./(1+exp(Xtrain*weights)) >=0.5;
        error = y_predict ~= Ytrain;
        %error = norm(weights - b,2);
        error_per_iter(iter) = mean(error);
