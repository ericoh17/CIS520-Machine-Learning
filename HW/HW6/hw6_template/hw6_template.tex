\maketitle

\paragraph*{Instructions.} 
Please write up your responses to the following problems clearly and
concisely. 
We encourage you to write up your responses using \LaTeX{}; we have provided a \LaTeX{} template, available on Canvas, to make this easier. 
{\bf Submit your answers in PDF form to Canvas. 
	We will not accept paper copies of the homework.}

Note, there is no automatic grader for this homework but you do need to submit your code for grading. 
Please add your MATLAB code snippets inline with your solutions. We encourage you to use  \(\mathtt{mcode}\) or \(\mathtt{listings}\) packages for \LaTeX. Code submitted separately will not be graded.

\paragraph*{Collaboration.} 
You are allowed and encouraged to work together. You may discuss the homework to understand the problem and reach a solution in groups up to size {\bf two students.} 
However, each student must write down the solution independently, and without referring to written notes from the joint session. 
{\bf In addition, each student must write on the problem set the names of the people with whom you collaborated.
	It is OK to submit the exact same code used by the partner who you listed in this HW submission.}
You must understand the solution well enough in order to reconstruct it by yourself. (This is for your own benefit: you have to take the exams alone.) \\
